# PawlsByte GitHub Pages

This repository hosts multiple HTML files and the `americlean-ascs-study` training site. To view the ASCS study materials on GitHub Pages, visit:

```
https://pawlsbyte.github.io/americlean-ascs-study/
```

If the pages do not appear, ensure the `work` branch has been merged into `main` and GitHub Pages is configured to build from the `main` branch.
The `americlean-ascs-study` folder contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the online study portal.
